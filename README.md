# Stories Coffee – Data Analytics Hackathon

## Business Problem

Stories Coffee operates a growing multi-branch café chain with a diverse product mix spanning beverages, food, and seasonal offerings.  
The leadership team seeks to better understand **what actually drives revenue and profit across branches, products, and seasons**, and where operational or pricing inefficiencies may be silently eroding margins.

The objective of this hackathon project is to transform raw point-of-sale data into **clear, actionable business insights** that can support:

- Smarter menu and upsell strategies  
- Better seasonal planning and staffing  
- Early detection of profit leakage  
- More balanced branch performance across the network

## Approach & Methodology

The analysis follows a structured, layered approach designed to move from **data trust → insight → action**.

### Analysis Layers

#### Part 1 – Data Quality & Exploration
- Missing value audit across all four datasets  
- Descriptive statistics to understand distributions, ranges, and outliers  
- Initial data previews to resolve multi-page exports, repeated headers, and misaligned month blocks  

#### Part 2 – Core Visualisations & Business Analysis
The following analytical views were produced:

- Top 10 products by total profit  
- Beverages vs. Food category comparison  
- Monthly sales performance by branch  
- Top products by profit margin  
- Sales volume vs. margin scatter analysis  
- Branch performance rankings (profit + margin)  
- Seasonality heatmap (branch × month, normalised)  
- Beverages vs. Food deep dive per branch  
- Product group Pareto (revenue concentration)  
- Take-Away vs. Dine-In operational split  
- Margin outliers: loss leaders & high-margin stars  
- New branch ramp-up curves  
- Revenue concentration analysis  

This structure ensures insights are both **statistically grounded** and **business-relevant**.

## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Frozen Yoghurt Outperforms Every Coffee Category
Frozen Yoghurt is the single largest revenue group at approximately **21% of total chain revenue**, surpassing Mixed Cold Beverages (15%), Mixed Hot Beverages (15%), and Black Coffee (6%).  
For a brand called *Stories Coffee*, this represents a major strategic insight with implications for branding, menu focus, and expansion.

### 2. Structural 14-Point Margin Gap: Beverages vs. Food
Beverages consistently achieve **~77% profit margins**, while food averages **~63%**.  
This margin gap appears at **every branch without exception**, indicating a structural cost reality rather than local pricing decisions.

### 3. Predictable 3× Seasonal Revenue Swing
Across 2025, revenue peaks in **July–August and October** and troughs in **May and September**, producing a consistent **3× peak-to-trough swing**.  
Faqra exhibits inverse seasonality due to ski-resort dynamics, requiring a separate operational model.

### 4. Silent Profit Leakage from POS Pricing Errors
Decaf shot modifiers are priced at **£0** while incurring positive ingredient costs across multiple branches.  
This is a POS configuration error generating negative profit at scale — the **highest-ROI fix** identified in the analysis.

### 5. Profit Concentration Risk Across Branches
Approximately **45–50% of total chain profit** is generated by just **five branches**, with Ain El Mreisseh alone contributing ~15%.  
New 2025 branches show healthy ramp-up curves, reaching ~65% of steady-state revenue within three months, offering a clear path to reducing concentration risk.

## Final Note

This project focuses on **decision-quality insights**, not academic modeling.  
Every finding is framed to support **real operational and strategic actions** Stories Coffee can implement immediately.
